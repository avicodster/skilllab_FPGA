# RVCE FPGA Workshop Repo Summary

Team Members:Aviral, Bhini, Sowrabha

### Objectives:

1. FPGA VDI Installation
   This covers setting up the VDI environment on an FPGA board, preparing it for development and testing of hardware projects.We installed ORACLE virtualbox for creating a virtual machine which helped us further execute the experiments.
2.Communicate via UART using `picocom`
3. LED Blinking and UART Loopback
   A hands-on introduction to digital I/O with FPGA: blinking an LED helps verify GPIO control, while UART and UART loopback demonstrate serial communication and data verification.
